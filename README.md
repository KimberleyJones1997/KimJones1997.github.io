# Hello I'm Kim
## Welcome to My First GitHub Page

I am currently part of the Dimension Data GAP 2020 program. 

### More about me:

 

 I am 25 years old and I grew up in Underberg, KZN. I went to boarding school in Pietermaritzburg at The Wykeham Collegiate and I then went on to study at Stellenbosch University. I did a Bachelor of Science in Biodiversity and Ecology. 
 
 After graduating, I went to Vietnam and taught English there for 18 months. I then found myself working at Londolozi Game Reserve for another 18 months in the hospitality industry. 

 

### Projects

 

 We rotate throughout Dimension Data and we have already been in the Digital Advisory space, spent time with the Customer Experience Team and we have been through the Sales department. I look forward to what the rest of the year has in store, whether it be virtual or back at The Campus. 
 
### Goals

 

 I am eager to learn as much as possible this year and in some way make a difference. I would love to get involved in Connected Conservation.
