# Hello I'm Kim
## Welcome to My First GitHub Page

I am currently part of the Dimension Data GAP 2020 program. 

### More about me:

 I am 23 years old and I grew up in Johnnesburg. I went to school at St Anrews School for Girls from grade 0-12 and I then went on to study at Stellenbosch University. I did a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Political Science and English. I then did my honours at UCT in Management and Entrepreneurship.  
 
 I love cooking and obviously eating. It is a huge hobbie of mine and I spend all of my free time experimenting with different recipes. 
 
### Projects

 We rotate throughout Dimension Data and we have already been in the Digital Advisory space, spent time with the Customer Experience Team and we have been through the Sales department. I look forward to what the rest of the year has in store, whether it be virtual or back at The Campus. I have really enjoyed my time at Dimension Data so far and have met the most amazing people.  
 
### Goals

 I am eager to learn as much as possible this year and in some way make a difference. My goal for this year is to learn as much as possible about Dimension Data as well as get in touch with my technical side as it is all completely new to me. However, I feel like making this website is a step in that direction.
